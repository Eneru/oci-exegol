## Prerequisites
### Needed files
Some files were not added in the repository *(for privacy / security purpose)* and need to be added to be able to use it.
In the `.oci` folder, you will need to add the `config` file generated when you [generated the API key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm).
The .pem *(private key)* needs to be in this folder too.
